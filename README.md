# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sasha Kolpakov. I have a background in mathematics, ranging from combinatorics, to Riemannian geometry, to data science and machine learning. In my free time, I enjoy my family, good food, and occasionally some good weather ðŸ˜„.

## ðŸ”­ Current Projects

- [DiRe: a JAX-based dimension reduction algorithm for big data](https://github.com/sashakolpakov/dire-jax)
- [GraphEm: a graph embedding for efficient centrality measures approximation](https://github.com/sashakolpakov/graphem)
- [Einit :: ×¢×™× ×™×ª :: Fast and Robust ICP initialization](https://github.com/sashakolpakov/einit)

## ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ...

applications of embeddings, metrics, and Riemannian geometry in general (and other maths) to data analysis and computer vision

## ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...

machine learning for computer vision, medical imaging, and all kinds of projects with potential real life impact
